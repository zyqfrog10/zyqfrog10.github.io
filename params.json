{"name":"Hello World!","tagline":"Record something useful!","body":"## How to update R without re-installing packages on Mac OS\r\nR is a fast developing language/software. I am glad to update it as often as possible to enjoy new features. However, updating R is not always an enjoyable thing when you have a bunch of packages that do not migrate to your new version automatically. Here are some tips that may save us some time compared to manually downloading everything again. \r\n(<b>Note:</b> Since I am using Mac, the tips are Mac based.)\r\n\r\n### Install new version of R\r\nJust follow the steps as you first time install R:\r\n\r\n1.    Go to http://www.r-project.org\r\n\r\n2.    Click on 'CRAN', 'CRAN mirror', or 'download R'\r\n\r\n3.    Choose a CRAN \r\n\r\n4.    Click on 'Download R for XXX', where XXX is your operating system\r\n\r\n5.    Download the new version of R\r\n\r\n6.    Follow the installation procedure for your operating system\r\n\r\n### Copy your packages to the new version R\r\nNow you have a new R, but only have base packages in the library. Let's enrich the new library without downloading packages one by one.\r\n\r\n1.    Copy the packages from the old R library into the new one on Mac OS\r\n    Example:\r\n    ```\r\n        cp -r -n /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library/  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library/\r\n    ```\r\n    <b>Note:</b> -rn is necessary to copy entire folder without overwriting existing packages in the new destination.\r\n\r\n2.    Update your packages\r\n    ```\r\n        update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE)\r\n    ```\r\n    At this step, I encountered a warning message after downloading failed:\r\n    \"Warning: cannot remove prior installation of package 'XXX'\", where XXX is any package on the top of the list.\r\n    Don't know why this happened. The good thing is re-installing new version R will fix it (copied packages are still there, you don't have to repeat the copy step.).\r\n\r\n### If you use Rstudio\r\nSimply open up Rstudio, new version R is automatically loaded. \r\nIn my case, updating to R3.2, I got an error message like 'Error in tools:::httpdPort <= 0L : \r\ncomparison (4) is possible only for atomic and list types.' Then I updated my Rstudio to the latest version and the problem got solved by itself. \r\n\r\n### Alternative solution\r\nYou may go the link http://zvfak.blogspot.com/2012/06/updating-r-but-keeping-your-installed.html for an alternative solution. The following is a summary.\r\n\r\n1.    Build your own library path that should be indicated in ~/.Renviron file\r\n    ```\r\n        mkdir ~/Rlib\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2.    Create a .Renviron file in your home directory with the following line in the content\r\n    ```\r\n        R_LIBS=~/Rlibs\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3.    Update R as usual and packages in ~/Rlibs are intact\r\n\r\n4.    Update packages as you normally do with update.packages()\r\n\r\n### Enjoy your new R!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
